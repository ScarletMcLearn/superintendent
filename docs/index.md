# Superintendent documentation

![](logo.png)

Superintendent is designed to provide flexible `ipywidget`-based tools for
labelling your data and growing your algorithm. At the moment this is restricted
to simply giving you the ability to label your data, but in the future, the
package will allow you to synergise with your algorithm and label only the data
that's worth labelling.
